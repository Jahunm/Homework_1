Ripple Labs is in the blockchain domain of fintech but the implications of their blockchain traverse many domains in fintech like paytech (payment and remittance technology) for example. I would classify them as a blockchain domain even though they could be seen as paytech domain of fintech.

	In the past 5-10 years several major trends in fintech have emerged, such as blockchains use of the distributed ledger. There is also digital transformation creating new digital payment systems and mobile banking apps. Artificial intelligence is another huge trend that helps with customer service, fraud detection and risk management. AI is even used to create automize trading algorithms to facilitate less exposure in trading of stocks or cryptocurrencies. Defi or decentralized finance is another big trend to emerge from blockchain technology.

	Other major companies in this domain includes 
•	Coinbase: A crypto exchange to buy and sell cryptocurrencies.
•	Binance: A crypto exchange for buying and selling but also its own open-source blockchain 
•	Chainalysis: Provide analysis of blockchain to government agencies, exchanges, and financial institutions
•	Uniswap: Decentralized exchange that enables users to trade cyprtocurrencies without intermediaries.
•	Compound: Lending platform that enables users to earn interest on the their cryptocurrencies.
•	Aave: A lending platform using DeFi that enables users to borrow and lend cryptocurrencies without intermediaries.
